.SH NAME
likwid-setFrequencies \- print and manage the clock frequency of CPU cores
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B likwid-setFrequencies 
.RB [\-hpl]
.RB [ \-c
.IR <cpu_list,_socket_list_or_expression> ]
.RB [ \-g
.IR <governor> ]
.RB [ \-f
.IR <frequency> ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B likwid-setFrequencies
is a command line application to set the clock frequency of CPU cores. Since only priviledged users are allowed to change the frequency of CPU cores, the application works in combination with a daemon 
.B likwid-setFreq.
The daemon needs the suid permission bit to be set in order to manipulate the sysfs entries. With 
.B likwid-setFrequencies
the clock of all cores inside a the cpu_list or affinity domain can be set to a specific frequency or governor at once.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-h
prints a help message to standard output, then exits.
.TP
.B \-p
prints the current frequencies for all CPU cores
.TP
.B \-l
prints all configurable frequencies
.TP
.B \-\^c " <cpu_list,_socket_list_or_expression>
set the affinity domain where to set the frequencies. Common are N (Node), SX (Socket X), CX (Cache Group X) and MX (Memory Group X). For detailed information about affinity domains see
.B likwid-pin(1)
.TP
.B \-\^g " <governor>
set the governor of all CPU cores inside the affinity domain. Current governors are ondemand, performance, turbo. Default is ondemand
.TP
.B \-\^f " <frequency>
set a fixed frequency at all CPU cores inside the affinity domain. Implicitly sets userspace governor for the cores.
