.SH NAME
likwid-accessD \- This tool forwards the access operations from LIKWID PerfMon tools
to the MSR device files
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B likwid-accessD
is a command line application that opens a UNIX file socket and waits for access
operations from LIKWID tools that require access to the MSR and PCI device
files. The MSR and PCI device files are only accessible for users with root
privileges, therefore
.B likwid-accessD
requires the suid-bit set.
Depending on the current system architecture,
.B likwid-accessD
permits only access to registers defined for the architecture.
