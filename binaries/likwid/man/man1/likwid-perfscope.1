.SH NAME
likwid-perfscope \- Frontend for the timeline mode of
.N likwid-perfctr(1)
that on-the-fly generates pictures from the measurements
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B likwid-perfscope 
.RB [\-h]
.RB [ \-cores
.IR <cpu_list> ]
.RB [ \-freq
.IR <frequency> ]
.RB [ \-group
.IR <eventset> ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B likwid-perfscope
is a command line application written in Perl that uses the timeline daemon mode of
.B likwid-perfctr(1)
to create on-the-fly pictures with the current measurements. It uses the
.B feedGnuplot(1)
script to send the current data to gnuplot.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-h
prints a help message to standard output, then exits.
.TP
.B \-\^cores " <cpu_list>
measures the given group on given CPUs in <cpu_list>
.TP
.B \-\^freq " <frequency>
reads the current performance values every <frequency>. Available suffixes are 's' and 'ms', e.g. 500ms. Default value is 1s
.TP
.B \-\^group " <eventset>
defines the events and counters that should be read. Possible values can be gathered from
.B likwid-perfctr(1).
Default is group 'FLOPS_DP'

.SH EXAMPLE
.IP 1. 4
Monitor double precision floating-point operations:
.TP
.B likwid-perfscope -group FLOPS_DP -cores 0-3 -freq 500ms
.PP
Executes
.B likwid-perfctr
on the first four cores. The values are read every 500ms are forwarded to gnuplot using the
.B feedGnuplot
script.
