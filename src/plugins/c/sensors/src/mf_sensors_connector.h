/** @file mf_sensors_connector.h
 *  @brief Interface to the sensors component of the sensors library.
 *
 *  This interface declares a means to access measurements of the sensors
 *  component, which is provided by the sensors library. Please see the
 *  {@link utils/mf_sensors_client.c mf_sensors_client} for a usage example. Per
 *  default, a developer should first determine if the sensors component is enabled
 *  (#mf_sensors_is_enabled), then initialize the plug-in via calling
 *  #mf_sensors_init, before doing the actual sampling using #mf_sensors_sample. At
 *  the end, the plug-in should be cleaned by executing #mf_sensors_shutdown.
